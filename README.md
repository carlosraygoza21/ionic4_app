## How to

### **SIGN UP**  
The next screenshots show step by step how the process to register is. 
If an e-mail is not registered already, the process for *create* is going to be active.

### **LOG IN**  
If an e-mail is already in the database, the process is going to ask only for the password to be able to log in.
